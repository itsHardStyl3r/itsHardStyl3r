Most notably known for my work on LineageOS for LG G3. Connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksander-gencel-07447233a/).

My current tech stack is **Go**, **Java** and **TypeScript**. Eager to learn more every day.

LineageOS is a free, community-built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android, which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android OS.

I've been successfully developing it for quite some time now as I started in [late 2017](https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-lineageos-17-1.3689278/) with my first public LineageOS 15.0 Oreo release. Still offering support and active development. Started work on newer versions, too.

### [The Swift Codes](https://github.com/itsHardStyl3r/the-swift-codes)
**Stack**: Go (Gin, Gorm), MariaDB, Docker/podman

A project I started as an internship challenge during which I tried and learned Go and containerization. This is basically a CRUD application for bank related information, head over to [the project's README](https://github.com/itsHardStyl3r/the-swift-codes?tab=readme-ov-file#the-swift-codes-project) to read more.

### [Payment deals](https://github.com/itsHardStyl3r/payment-deals)
**Stack**: Java

A project for an internship challenge. A simple Java program that shows the best payment method for a given orders based on the provided payment methods and their discounts.

### [Toolsies](https://github.com/itsHardStyl3r/toolsies) & [Webtoolsies](https://github.com/itsHardStyl3r/webtoolsies) **(Abandoned)**
**Web app stack**: Java 17, Spring Boot, MariaDB, maven, React JS, axios, Bootstrap<br>
**Plugin stack**: Java 17, Paper MC API, bcrypt, maven<br>

A minecraft plugin with a website that I made originally made to learn Java. Over the span of couple years, it was rewritten six times. This is my own take on [Essentials plugin](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials) for Bukkit servers, basically it adds QOL changes. The website was supposed to be player management site with a forum for everybody to use and admin control panel.
